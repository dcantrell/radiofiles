Radio models found in the codeplugs/ subdirectory.

DJ-G29
    Alinco DJ-G29[T] dual band handheld transceiver.  This is a dual
    220 MHz (VHF) and 902 MHz (UHF) amateur radio.  The software to
    program the radio comes from www.alinco.com and is simply called
    "Clone Utility" for this particular radio.  The DJ-G29T is the
    US version of the radio.

HT750
    Motorola HT750 handheld radio.  We have the 16 channel UHF versions
    of these radios.

HT1250
    Motorola HT1250 handheld radio.  We have the 128 channel limited
    keypad VHF models.  Model AAH25KDF9AA5AN.  This model can do some
    trunking and signaling, but that doesn't matter for us as we will
    only ever use them in conventional mode.  You can use zones though
    to group the conventional frequencies, which is really nice.
