Radio models found in the codeplugs/ subdirectory.

DJ-G29
    Alinco DJ-G29[T] dual band handheld transceiver.  This is a dual
    220 MHz (VHF) and 902 MHz (UHF) amateur radio.  The software to
    program the radio comes from www.alinco.com and is simply called
    "Clone Utility" for this particular radio.  The DJ-G29T is the
    US version of the radio.

HT750
    Motorola HT750 handheld radio.  We have the 16 channel UHF versions
    of these radios.

HT1250
    Motorola HT1250 handheld radio.  We have the 128 channel limited
    keypad VHF models.  Model AAH25KDF9AA5AN.  This model can do some
    trunking and signaling, but that doesn't matter for us as we will
    only ever use them in conventional mode.  You can use zones though
    to group the conventional frequencies, which is really nice.

MTX9250
    Motorola MTX9250 handheld radio, a 900MHz radio.  This radio looks
    very similar to the styling of the Waris radios, but it uses
    different firmware and also a completely different version of CPS
    to program it.  It does trunking and conventional and is set up in
    zones similar to the Waris radios.

XPR7550
    Motorola MOTOTRBO XPR7550 radio, both the VHF and UHF versions.  The
    DMR radio series from Motorola.  The 7550 is now discontinued and
    replaced with the 7550e.  The XPR7550 works great in conventional mode
    too and has plenty of room for lots of zones and channels.  FPP is
    available via third party firmware on the option board.  None of the
    Waris accessories work on the MOTOTRBO radios, especially and including
    the antennas.
