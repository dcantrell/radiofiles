Using 16 channels on a programmable UHF radio, we can mix GMRS, FRS,
and LMR frequencies.  All channels are simplex, meaning the frequency
listed is the Tx and Rx frequency.

These channels will all use 11K2F3E or 7K60FXW emission.  11K2F3E is
analog FM with 2.5 khz deviation, also known as "narrowband 12.5 khz".
7K60FXW is 2-slot DMR (Motorola MOTOTRBO) TDMA data + voice and is
only allowed on the non-FRS and non-GMRS channels.  In practice we
make everything analog.

For the LMR frequencies, be sure to use the commercial license for the
group.  Likewise with GMRS.  The group license if it's just family,
otherwise everyone has to have a call.  The dual GMRS/FRS channels can
alleviate the need to constantly ID if you have a large mixed group.

NOTE: The power output on the GMRS/FRS channels is set to maximum so
technically that makes them GMRS frequencies and the ID'ing is
required.  However, these channels are most useful for groups that
have FRS purpose built radios mixed in with these radios.  If you know
you'll have that, you can allocate some FRS channels to be low power
(or switch to low power when on the channel).  You're still at 1 watt
likely and using a radio with a detachable antenna, but...well,
whatever.
