CPS R02.01.03 is the "Motorola Professional Trunking CPS" which can speak
to MTX8250 and MTX9250 radios, the latter being the useful one for ham
radio.

The default frequency limits will not let you program ham radio
frequencies.

MODIFY THE FREQUENCY LIMITS

1) Make a copy of cps_95nt.exe to something like cps_95nt_orig.exe

2) Open cps_95nt.exe in a hex editor.

3) Find all of these strings:

       94 28 BB 37

   and replace it with:

       D4 10 68 35

   It should be noted that those are hexidecimal byte values.

4) Save and exit.

When you run CPS, you should be able to program ham frequencies.  This
hack also prevents CPS from silently adjusted out of band frequencies to
either the low or high edge without your knowing (this is useful if you
open a codeplug file from another ham).

CLONING RADIOS

Cloning one radio's codeplug to another saves an enormous amount of time
because the CPS user interface is nearly unusable.  However, since the
MTX9250 really wants to be a trunking radio, CPS is built to work in that
world.  Cloning first ensures you have the system keys for the System ID
in the radio you are cloning before it will let you write out the data to
another radio.  Don't have a System ID in your radio?  Awesome!  It's
really luck of the draw on eBay.

I followed these instructions:

    http://www.batlabs.com/syskey.html

And it did not work.  hamfiles has skeygen.exe which generated a working
system key file called SYS0A824.KEY.  The contents are entirely different
from what Batlabs suggested.
