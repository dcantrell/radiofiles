Different versions of CPS modified to program the MTX9250 for 33cm ham
frequencies.  The subdirectories correspond to the version of CPS used.

I am using version R02.01.03-AA which is what I managed to buy from Motorola
and then modify for ham frequencies.  Version R02.03.00 does work, but also
requires the modification.  What makes it odd is that the more recent version
number is not available from Motorola anymore.  It's not a typo, the more
recent version is a different build and the filesizes do not match.

None of it really matters so long as you have a working version that can
program the MTX9250 for ham frequencies.  This version of CPS (Professional
Trunking CPS) is arguably the worst version of CPS that I have ever used.
It is not like Waris CPS or MOTOTRBO CPS.  It's worse.  There's not even a
grid view of personalities and worst of all there is no copy and paste.

Good luck.
